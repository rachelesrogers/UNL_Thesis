# Jury Perception Revisited: This Time with Chibis {#study2}

- When reading a transcript, experts may seem impartial when they are in fact called by the prosecution
- There are few to no visuals to keep track of who is speaking, and what characters are present in a scenario
- We wanted to develop a general tool that can be used in online courtroom studies, making it easier to track sides/speakers, and with versatility in terms of race/gender

- Other changes: 
  - combating scale compression through jury instructions before deliberation
  - Fixing code design so to prevent copy/paste error
  - Changing Likert scales to quantitative scales to get more numerical differences
