# Jury Perception Revisited: This Time with Caricatures {#study2}

<!--- Chibis -->
- Study 2 changes can be found in Appendix \@ref(study-2-changes)
- When reading a transcript, experts may seem impartial when they are in fact called by the prosecution
- There are few to no visuals to keep track of who is speaking, and what characters are present in a scenario
- We wanted to develop a general tool that can be used in online courtroom studies, making it easier to track sides/speakers, and with versatility in terms of race/gender

- Other changes:
  - combating scale compression through jury instructions before deliberation
  - Fixed code design so to prevent copy-paste error
  - Comparing Likert scales to quantitative scales
  - Adding scenario id to database at beginning of test
- Reliability: Questions regarding the consistency of the comparison
  - How often to you think the firearms examiner makes mistakes?
     - [blank] out of [blank] bullet comparisons
   - How often to you think the algorithm makes mistakes?
     - [blank] out of [blank] bullet comparisons
   - If other examiners were asked to make the same bullet comparison, how many do you believe would agree with the firearms examiner
     - [blank] out of [blank] examiners would agree with Smith's results of bullet comparison
   - If the algorithm were re-run on the same bullet comparison, how many times do you believe the algorithm would agree with these results?
       - [blank] out of [blank] runs would agree with the results of the bullet comparison
   <!-- - Credibility: Perhaps questions regarding the ability to testify? Or something on credentials, or comparison to another individual -->
   - Scientificity: can directly compare to each other, or have a non-scientific portion to compare to
     - Did you find the algorithm or the bullet comparison to be more scientific?
     - Compared to the case description, how would you rate the scientificity of the bullet comparison
   - How much would you be willing to bet that the crime scene bullet (did/did not) match Cole's gun?
  
- Clarify if the examiner used the algorithm before or after their initial comparison.
 <!-- - If the algorithm is used first, this would potentially be confounding -->
