# Text analysis with Transcripts {#textcolor}

- Participants of the first study were allowed to take notes while reading through the transcripts, which are saved by page number
- We would like to use this to highlight which parts of the testimonies the participants found to be important

- First attempt:
  - ggplot: allows for both a gradient and transparency to be added to words based on their frequency
  - graphing words of the transcript resulted in ugly spacing
  - Relative frequency was computed based on the number of times the word appeared on the page
- Second attempt:
  - Using LaTex instead of ggplot: can set gradient through color outputted by ggplot
  - Words can be equally spaced
  - Currently assigning a new color to each word - this is not efficient
  - Now in CSS for tab format
  - Labels added with gradient scale
  - Change from relative frequency of individual words to average collocation frequency per word (with collocations of length 5)
     -Include fuzzy matching for indirect matches (typos/skipped words)
