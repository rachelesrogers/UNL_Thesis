## Introduction

Note taking is commonly used when individuals are provided with a large amount of information that they may want to reference later. 
These notes can act as a guide in terms of what items of information the note taker found most important. 
By fluidly connecting notes from multiple note takers to the information presented, one may be able to discover the most ‘noteworthy’ pieces of information, and compare the perception of the note takers to the goal of the presenter. 
To this end, we have designed a method for highlighting presented information, in the form of a transcript, to correspond to the notes of participants in order to form a ‘heatmap’ for the information that participants found worth recording. This method can provide valuable information about what participants chose to, or not to, record. 
There were two important steps to this process: the text cleaning of cumulative notes, and the mapping of phrase frequency to form a ‘heatmap’. 
The sequential note cleaning is necessary when participants take notes on a single notepad, but their notes are saved multiple times throughout the study as they were presented with new information. 
By isolating the notes taken at each time point through text cleaning, we can isolate notes corresponding to the presentation of specific information. 
This was accomplished through a combination of two methods (First N Character and Longest Common Substring) used to identify which notes have been added, presumably corresponding to the new information. 
These individualized notes can then be mapped to the information presented through the use of collocations, or phrases of a set length.
Once the frequency with which each phrase of information appears in participant notes is calculated, this frequency can be mapped to a corresponding color to create a highlighting gradient that illuminates areas of participant focus. 
This method was developed and tested on a trial transcript study designed to assess juror perceptions of the use of algorithms and demonstrative evidence in the courtroom.

### Literature Review

#### First N Character Method
The First \authorcol{N} Character (FNC) method relies on the concept of edit distance for matching and removing previous notes from sequential study documents.
I developed this method specifically for the cleaning of sequential notes.
In this process, a previous page's notes are matched to the next page's notes in order to remove duplicate text.
This is a form of pattern matching.
In a reference to algorithmic detection of plagiarism in computer programs, @parker1989 describe an algorithm that uses the character differences in order to compare how similar programs are.
Other algorithms discussed in @parker1989 use code-specific features such as number of operators, lines of comments, and number of various loop statements.
Because we are only concerned with the content of the notes, there is little information to be gained from formatting: a notable difference from the plagiarism detection problem.

There are many examples of pattern matching in text analysis - such as @baeza-yates and @landau1988. 
These papers rely on a set pattern to be found in the reference text, with a defined number of differences allowed between the pattern and the text. 
According to @baeza-yates, many algorithmic methods have been developed to solve this problem, with allowances for mismatches between the reference text and the pattern.
A similar allowance for differences is present in @landau1988, where differences are defined as either insertions, deletions, or substitutions.
This definition of differences is the same definition that is used in computing Levenshtein distance, also known as edit distance [@levenshtein].
Levenshtein considered the issue of insertions, deletions, and substitutions with binary code.
This concept \authorcol{w}as later extended to include more extensive strings, as demonstrated by @konstantinidis2005.
The edit distance can be used to determine the extent of matching text when comparing two sequential note sheets, in order to identify if a portion of notes should be removed.

| Word 1 | Word 2 | Transformation | Method | Edit Distance |
|:-------:|:--------:|:----------------:|:--------:|:---------------:|
| caw     | cow    | a &rarr; o    | substitution | 1 |
| inveigh | neigh | \textcolor{gray}{i}n\textcolor{gray}{v}eigh | deletion | 2 |
| meow | homeowner | \textcolor{red}{ho}meow\textcolor{red}{ner} | insertion | 5 |
| Shire  |  Shareholder  |  i &rarr; a + \textcolor{red}{holder} | substitution and insertion | 7 |

: Transformations used to calculate Edit Distance (\#tab:edist)

The edit distance is the number of characters that would need to be changed in order to transform the first string into the second string.
This includes insertions, deletions, and substitutions, in the case of the "adist" function [@utils].
These different transformations are shown in Table \@ref(tab:edist).
For example, "caw" and "cow" would have an edit distance of 1, because the strings match if the "a" is turned into an "o".
This is an example of substitution.
Similarly, "inveigh" and "neigh" would have an edit distance of 2, since 2 characters are deleted ("i" and "v").
Finally, "meow" and "homeowner" would have an edit distance of 5, because 5 characters are added.
These operations can also be combined in edit distance calculations.
For example, going from "Shire" to "Shareholder" would require both a substitution and insertion.

Although edit distance can be used to calculate the similarity between notes, there is no set pattern that guarantees removal.
While the analysis is based on the previous page of notes, individuals do not always keep the previous page of notes the same - some delete parts, and some add new information in the middle. 
Instead of only aiming to remove exact matches of the previous note sheet, we must factor in partial and discontinuous notes as well.

#### Longest Common Substring Method

Whereas calculating edit distance between two pages of notes is useful when finding notes that wholly match the previous page, the Longest Common Substring (LCS) method can be used to find pieces of notes that match between pages, so that this repeated text can be removed.
The LCS method accomplishes this goal through searching for common text between two sequential pages to be removed.
For example, in Figure \@ref(fig:lcs), the LCS between the two strings is "the cat enjoys napping".
In the process of note cleaning, this would be the string that is removed from the second page of notes, resulting in "When it is quiet" as the cleaned (non-repeated) notes.

```{r}
#| lcs,
#| fig.cap= "Longest Common Substring Diagram",
#| fig.width= 7,
#| fig.align= "center",
#| echo= FALSE,
#| message= FALSE,
#| warning= FALSE

 include_graphics(path = "images/svg_graph.png")
# library(webshot)
# grViz("digraph {
#   graph [layout = dot, rankdir = TB]
# 
#   node [shape = rectangle]
#   rec1 [label = 'Page 1\n the cat enjoys napping in the afternoon']
#   rec2 [label = 'Page 2\nWhen it is quiet, the cat enjoys napping']
#   rec3 [label =  'LCS\n the cat enjoys napping']
#   rec4 [label = 'Page 2 Clean\nWhen it is quiet']
# 
#   # edge definitions with the node IDs
#   rec1 -> rec3
#   rec2 -> rec3
#   rec3 -> rec4
#   }",
#   height = 500, width=800)

```

Methods for computing the longest common substring between two sequences have been used to compare biological sequences [@crochemore2017].
Solutions for finding the longest common substring utilize either the construction of a suffix tree [@charalampopoulos2021] or table [@landau1988].
The suffix tree method is described by @gusfield1997; in short, each unique suffix of a string would contribute a new branch to the suffix tree, where leaves consist of the string's terminal character: \$.
<!-- This is used avoid recurrence with previous characters in the string. -->

A solution implemented by @ptxqc in a CRAN R package constructs a matrix that records the length of a matching string at character $i$ for string 1 (in the $i$th row), and character $j$ for string 2 (in the $j$th column).
Because an R implementation is readily available, this is the solution used for this analysis, even though @ptxqc warns that this LCS method is inefficient, and meant to be used in small instances.
This method creates an empty matrix, where the number of rows correspond to the length of the first string, and the number of columns correspond to the length of the second string.
Thus, the first cell would correspond to the first character of both strings, and so on.
If the characters match and it is the first row or column, then the cell gets a value of 1.
If the characters match and it is not the first row or column, the the cell receives the value of the (i-1,j-1) cell plus one.
The first string's index for the substring of the longest length is saved.
This process is shown in Table \@ref(tab:dylcs), with two strings: "gratuitous" and "intuitive".
The diagonal of numbers in red indicate the longest substring, beginning and ending with 't'.
Thus, "tuit" is identified as the LCS.

_ | g | r | a | t | u | i | t | o | u | s
--|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
i | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
t | 0 | 1 | 0 | \textcolor{red}{1} | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0
u | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | \textcolor{red}{2} | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0
i | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | \textcolor{red}{3} | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
t | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | \textcolor{red}{4} | 0 | 0 | 0
i | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
v | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
e | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0

: Dynamic Programming for LCS (\#tab:dylcs)

#### Collocation Analysis and Fuzzy Matching

After the notes are cleaned, sequences of 5 words (collocations) are used to find areas of the testimony that participants focus on.
For indirect matches, such as typos, weights are applied to these fuzzy matches to contribute to the total count. 
While collocations traditionally refer to words that occur more frequently together - such as "white house"(@DefinitionCOLLOCATION2023), tools for collocation analysis helpfully provide the frequency of occurrence for strings of a specified length (@collocationpage). 

Character differences can effectively be used to indicate similarity between participants' notes and the text transcript.
This is useful in situation\authorcol{s} where individuals do not copy the notes directly.
In these cases, fuzzy matching can be used to find the transcript collocation that is the most similar to the participants' written notes.
This approximate string matching allows for matching strings that do not correspond directly (@gusfield1997), which allows for matching up participants' inexact notes with the closest transcript collocation.

In order to perform fuzzy matching on the indirect collocations from participants' notes, I used 'stringdist_join' from the 'fuzzyjoin' R package [@fuzzy]. 
This function conducts a join with the best matching observations from the second dataset. 
For example, consider asking young children to spell their birth month.
This may result in a dataset like Table \@ref(tab:months).

Name | Month
--------|--------
Billy | Mach
Jimmy | Apil 
Frances | Mae
Gary | Febary
Steve | Octobr
Bobby | Agust
Tammy | Febrey
Greg | Agast
Benny | Jur

: Dataset of misspelled months (\#tab:months)

We may then want to match the written months to their correctly spelled counterparts. 
While 'stringdist_join' will give values for all matches between the two data sets, we can then identify the month that is closest to the misspelled value.

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

months <- data.frame(month=c("January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August","September","October",
                             "November","December"))
classroom <- data.frame(month=c("Mach","Apil","Mae","Febary","Octobr","Agust","Febrey","Agast","Jur"), 
                    name=c("Billy","Jimmy","Frances","Gary","Steve","Bobby","Tammy","Greg","Benny"))

fuzzy_matches <-stringdist_join(months, classroom, 
                                  by='month', #match based on team
                                  mode='right', #use right join
                                  method = "lv", #use levenshtein distance metric
                                  max_dist=99, 
                                  distance_col='dist')%>%
    group_by(name) %>%
    slice_min(order_by=dist, n=1)

names(fuzzy_matches) <- c("Month", "Misspelled Month", "Name", "Edit Distance")

# kable(fuzzy_matches, caption="Fuzzy Match by Month") # %>%
#  kable_styling(position = "center")

fuzzy_matches %>%  pander(style = "grid",
         caption = "(\\#tab:fuzzymonth) Fuzzy Match by Month", justify = 'left')

```

In Table \@ref(tab:fuzzymonth), "Month" is the correctly spelled month, "Misspelled Month" is the child's spelling, and "Edit Distance" is the edit distance between the two words. 
In this case, Benny's spelling ("Jur") is equally close to "June" and "July", resulting in two listings.
This same concept is applied to matching collocations between a transcript and notepad.
In this case, the transcript is considered the "correct" version, and the participants' collocations that do not directly match are considered the misspellings.
This method finds the closest transcript collocation to the written collocation.

## Implementation

### Data Cleaning

#### First N Character (FNC) Method

Page 1         | Page 2             | FNC Edit Distance | FNC Page 2 Results
---------------|--------------------|----------|--------------
The cat ran | \textcolor{red}{The cat ran} up the tree | 0 | up the tree
The dog howled | \textcolor{red}{The cat ran up} the tree | 9 | The cat ran up the tree
The cat run | \textcolor{red}{The cat ran} up the tree | 1 | up the tree

: FNC Demonstration with an edit distance threshold of 3 (\#tab:fncmethod)

In scenarios such as those shown in Table \@ref(tab:fncmethod), a straightforward method for note cleaning would be to measure the length of the page 1 notes (n), and compare the previous notes to the first n characters in the page 2 notes (shown in red) via edit distance.
If the edit distance is small (indicating a correspondence to the previous page's notes), the first n characters can be removed.
In the first row, the page 1 notes perfectly align with the beginning of the page 2 notes, resulting in an edit distance of 0, and the duplicate text would be removed.
In the second row, the text between the two pages differs significantly (edit distance of 9), so the page 2 notes are left alone.
The threshold of allowable disagreement between two strings can be controlled through setting the maximum allowable edit distance.
This concept is demonstrated in the third row, the text was edited from "ran" to "run", resulting in an edit distance of 1.
However, because the two texts have the same meaning, regardless of the typo, we would still want to remove the duplicate text.
By allowing for some mismatch between the two pages, we can account for inexact matches in the text cleaning.

This method works well when participants take notes sequentially.
In some instances, however, participants will delete portions of their previous notes, add new notes either before or in the middle of their old notes, or duplicate their old notes.
When participants delete a portion of their notes or add new notes before/in the middle of their old notes, the edit distance between the old and new notes could be large.
The \authorcol{F}irst \authorcol{N} \authorcol{C}haracter method cannot appropriately clean these notes, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:issues).

#### Longest Common Substring (LCS) Method

Issue | Page 1 | Page 2 | LCS | Edit Distance
--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------
Deletion | The cat ran up the tree | The cat ran | The cat ran | 12
Insertion | The cat ran up the tree | \textcolor{red}{The cat ran, chased by a} dog, up the tree | (The cat ran)(up the tree) | 11
Duplication | The cat ran up the tree | \textcolor{red}{The cat ran up the tree} The cat ran up the tree | (The cat ran up the tree)(The cat ran up the tree) | 0

: LCS Comparison for FNC Issues (\#tab:issues)

The Longest Common Substring method is able to handle the issues found in the First \authorcol{N} Character method, which is demonstrated in Table \@ref(tab:issues).
If notes are deleted, the LCS method can identify the substring from the previous notes, despite the large edit distance that would prevent removal in the FNC method.
If new notes are inserted in the middle of previous notes, the FNC method would compare the Page 1's notes with the red text of the Page 2 notes shown in the second row, resulting in an edit distance that would prevent removal.
With the LCS method, the first substring "The cat ran" could be identified and removed, then in a second iteration, the second substring of "up the tree" can also be removed, leaving only the new text.
In the case of duplication, the FNC method would be able to identify the first iteration of text that matches Page 1 and remove it; but it would not be able to identify the second occurrence of the text.
As before, the LCS method would be able to identify both instances through two iterations, and remove all Page 1 text.
In the case of the LCS method, a threshold must be picked for the minimum matching substring length to be considered 'previous notes' and removed.
If the threshold is too small, the LCS method can identify words like "the" as matching previous testimony to be removed.
If the threshold is too large, the LCS method may be unable to remove substrings when new text is inserted in the middle of the old text.

### Note Analysis

#### Collocations

In order to analyze which areas of the text individuals focus on, we must first find a way to compare their notes to the written testimony.
One way to do this comparison is through collocation analysis, which uses the frequency of strings of sequentially-appearing words (n-grams) in order to identify words that tend to 'stick together'.
For example, in the case of the phrase "The cat ran up the tree", there would be three collocations of length 4, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:colex).
By matching the collocations that appear in the testimony to a frequency of the collocation from the participants' notepads, we can get frequency values for all n-grams that occur in the testimony.
The functions for creating highlighted text can be found in the package `highlightr` [@highlightr].

Collocation | The | cat | ran | up | the | tree
------------|-----|-----|-----|----|-----|-----
1           | The | cat | ran | up |     | 
2           |     | cat | ran | up | the | 
3           |     |     | ran | up | the | tree


: Collocations in "The cat ran up the tree" (\#tab:colex)

In setting the size of the collocation, there are two important factors to keep in mind: the frequency with which a phrase appears in the transcript itself, and the number of words in a row that individuals may directly copy from the transcript.
If the number of words considered in a collocation is too short, a phrase may occur multiple times throughout the transcript, without a way to distinguish which specific sections participants were recording.
For example, if we used a collocation of length two when analyzing an article about cats, a common phrase may be "cats are".
Because this phrase occurs  frequently in the article, it does not by itself tell us if there are particular portions of the article that individuals find important, even if we add weights to calculate the relative frequency.
On the other hand, if we use a collocation of length 10, it is unlikely that a large amount of individuals copied the exact 10-word phrase, which results in fewer observations.
In considering these two issues, we decided on a collocation size of 5.
This would be long enough to avoid many common phrases, but short enough that individuals may copy the phrase down directly.
The implementation of collocations used the 'quanteda' package [@quanteda], with guidance from a tutorial by @collocationpage.

Collocations are identified in the reference text, and assigned ordered word numbers (the first collocation of length 5 will have words 1-5, the second will have words 2-6, and so on). 
This data structure is similar to that shown in Table \@ref(tab:colex), where the collocation is length 4 instead of 5.
These are then bound with collocations from the participants' notes based on the sequence of 5 words, in order to assign a frequency to each collocation. 
We then take the average per word out of the possible collocations that the word could have appeared in.
For example, the first word can only appear in a single collocation (in Table \@ref(tab:colex), "The" only apprears in the first collocation, while "ran" appears in all three), so its average will be equal to the frequency of the first collocation. 
When multiple 5-grams appear in the same reference text, the note frequency is divided by the number of appearances in the reference text in order to account for multiple occurrences.

These frequency values are then assigned to a color on a color scale in order to create a highlighting gradient. 
We first implemented a graph of the testimony in 'ggplot2' [@ggplot] to assign color values to the frequencies based on a continuous gradient.
Then we used HTML gradient boxes, where the left color is that of the previous word, while the right color is based on the frequency of the current word.
This results in a smooth transition between words. 

#### Fuzzy Matching

At times, participants do not directly copy a collocation, but the correspondence is clear enough to match their notes to the transcript.
In these cases, we can use fuzzy matching to account for indirect collocations.
Because the intent of the participant is more clear with simple typos (such as a single letter change) than with larger differences (such as the changing of multiple words), the count for these fuzzily matched observations are weighted based on the edit distance.
I set a maximum edit distance of 99 to be considered a match.
Specifically, a weight of $\frac{1}{d+0.25}$ is used, where $d$ represents the edit distance (between 1 and 99).
An edit distance of 0 would receive a weight of 1, since fuzzy matching need not be applied.
Another factor in the calculation is the number of matches per 'misspelled' collocation.
To return to the month example shown in Table \@ref(tab:fuzzymonth), when Benny spelled a month "Jur", the edit distance to both "June" and "July" is 2.
It is then unclear which month Benny was born in, but they most likely meant June or July, as opposed to the other months.
Similarly, some collocation notes had the same edit distance for multiple transcript collocations.
In these cases, the frequency of the 'misspelled' collocation notes are split evenly between the closest transcript collocations.
This results in a total fuzzy frequency per transcript collocation of:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{x_i}{(d_i+0.25)c_i}
$$
where $x_i$ is the count for the participant's note collocation $i$, $d_i$ is the distance between the transcript collocation and the 'misspelled' collocation $i$, and $c_i$ is the number of transcript collocation matches for note collocation $i$.
This quantity is then added to the count of direct collocation matches calculated in the previous section.

#### Standardization

In many study designs, the study transcript may differ in specific places due to the experimental conditions.
For clarity, when the study transcript corresponds across all scenarios, the frequency for all scenarios can be considered together.
When the testimony diverges, each scenario can be considered separately.
In order to consistently evaluate the frequencies throughout the transcripts, the final frequency count was standardized by the number of scenarios included.
This would result in collocations with a final frequency weight of:

$$
(z+\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{x_i}{(d_i+0.25)c_i})\frac{1}{ks}
$$

In this case, $z$ is the count of direct matches; $\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{x_i}{(d_i+0.25)c_i}$ is the weighted fuzzy match count as defined above; $k$ is the number of times the collocation re-occurs in the transcript page itself; and $s$ is the number of scenarios included in the frequency count.

## Case Study

We applied this method to notes taken from a recent study on jury perception (described in Chapter \@ref(study1)).
Participants were asked to read over a testimony transcript when the defendant had been charged with attempted robbery and answer some questions related to the scenario. 
Conditions varied based on the examiner conclusion, the presence of images, and the presence of a bullet matching algorithm.
When the algorithm was present, participants also read the testimony of an algorithm developer, resulting in more pages of notes.
Participants were supplied with a notepad in order to take notes throughout the testimony. 
We are interested in comparing this notepad to the given testimony, in order to determine which portions of the testimony the participants found to be worth recording the most.
Portions of the testimony that bear the most similarity to the collective notes will be have a highlight color on the higher end of the gradient color scale than testimony that appears less frequently in the collective notes.
The method outlined above resulted in scenario testimonies that indicate where participants copied notes.

### The Data

```{r}
#| echo= FALSE,
#| message= FALSE,
#| warning= FALSE

study1_unclean_notes <- read.csv("data/study1_clean_notes.csv")

unclean_reduced <- study1_unclean_notes %>% filter(notes != "")


```

Our study consisted of `r length(unique(study1_unclean_notes$clean_prints))` uniquely recorded participants.
Of these `r length(unique(study1_unclean_notes$clean_prints))` participants, `r length(unique(unclean_reduced$clean_prints))` recorded something on the notepad.
This has resulted in `r format(dim(unclean_reduced)[1], big.mark = ",")` pages of notes with at least something recorded, out of `r format(dim(study1_unclean_notes)[1], big.mark = ",")` total pages.
For individuals who clicked through the survey multiple times but submitted a single result, the notes correspond to the closest time less than their submission time for observation per page number.
Note pages that corresponded to the questions (and not the testimony) were removed; this was above page 10 in conditions without the algorithm and page 19 in conditions with the algorithm.

### Data Cleaning

In this study, participants were provided with a notepad to record information while reading through mock trial testimony.
Because participants are provided with the same continuous notepad throughout the study, the database records a snapshot of their notes when they advance to the next page, providing a cumulative set of notes over time.
Table \@ref(tab:noteexample) is an example of what sequential notes may look like, taken from the second and third pages of a study participant's notes. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
comments <- read.csv("data/validation_dataset.csv")
# length(unique(subset(comments, notes != "")$clean_prints))
# val_prints <- sample(unique(subset(comments, notes != "")$clean_prints), size=30, replace=FALSE)
# 
# val_prints <- c(val_prints, 503, 359, 39, 368, 547)
# 
# val_dataset <- comments %>% subset(clean_prints %in% val_prints)
# 
# write.csv(val_dataset, "validation_dataset.csv")
# dim(val_dataset)

library(DT)
test_comments <-comments[1:4,]

table_comments <- test_comments %>% filter(page_count==2 | page_count==3) %>% dplyr::select(page_count, notes)

table_comments$notes <- str_wrap(table_comments$notes, width=35)
# 
# kable(test_comments %>% filter(page_count==2 | page_count==3) %>% dplyr::select(page_count, notes), caption="Participant Note Example")
# %>% column_spec(2, width = "30em")

# datatable(test_comments %>% filter(page_count==2 | page_count==3) %>% dplyr::select(page_count, notes), options = list(dom = 't'), caption="Participant Note Example")

test_comments %>% filter(page_count==2 | page_count==3) %>%
  dplyr::select(page_count, notes) %>%
  pander(style = "grid",
         caption = "(\\#tab:noteexample) Participant Note Example", justify = 'left',
         split.cells=60)


```

In order to appropriately clean the notes, the duplicated text ("discharge firearm in business- felony, not guilty") needs to be removed from the third page, to leave only notes that correspond to the third page's testimony.
A generalized version of the functions used in this data cleaning are included in the `seqstrclean` package [@seqstrclean].

#### Method Comparison Study

The FNC and LCS methods for sequential notepad cleaning were first tested on a subset of notes resulting from a jury perception survey.
In order to compare the FNC and LCS methods described above, I manually cleaned a subset of the survey response notes to have a "correct" baseline with which to calculate error rates.
This dataset consists of `r dim(comments)[1]` pages of 'notes' (including `r sum(comments$notes=="")` blanks) with 35 unique participants. 
30 participants were randomly selected from the larger dataset to test the method's effectiveness, while 5 participants were selected based on demonstrated issues with the existing data cleaning process. 
The 5 selected participants included an individual who deleted almost all of the beginning notes; two individuals who pasted new notes in the middle of old notes; an individual who duplicated notes; and an individual who included the algorithm expert's trial confirmation as well as the forensic scientist's - duplicate text that should be included as the new notes.

Table \@ref(tab:noteexample) shows two sequential note pages used in the method comparison dataset.
In this case, the FNC method could easily be applied; the page 2 notes perfectly align with the first part of the page 3 notes, resulting in an edit distance of 0 when comparing the first n characters of the third page.
Thus, by removing this beginning section, we would be left with the notes that are unique to page 3 - namely, "ski mask. no money, no injuries. 9mm, arrested after confiscated and testing."

For this method comparison study, I changed the FNC edit distance threshold with values of 0 character difference, 5 character difference, and 15 character difference (set as less than 1, less than 6, and less than 16).
In the method comparison study, I tried several different character length thresholds for the LCS method: 40 characters, half the previous note length, a third of the previous note length, and a fourth of the previous note length plus 5 (to compensate for shorter strings).

While the LCS method is able to solve the issues related to the First N Character method, such as cleaning notes that are not written sequentially, it has some issues of its own.
If the testimony itself contains duplicate text, such as the text related to swearing in witnesses, the LCS method would remove the new text that corresponds to the later testimony.
The other issue with the LCS method is the greater computational complexity.

##### Hybrid Method

Due to the benefits and drawbacks of both the LCS and FNC methods, I investigated the use of a hybrid method in the hope that the FNC method could be used as a quick way to clean the simplest cases of notes, while the LCS method could be used to clean up the notes that are less clear-cut.
In order to determine which observations would need the second cleaning method, I created Figure \@ref(fig:errorplot).

```{r}
#| errorplot,
#| fig.cap= "Error Comparison",
#| fig.width= 7,
#| fig.align= "center",
#| echo= FALSE,
#| message= FALSE,
#| warning= FALSE

completed_validation <- read_csv("data/full_validation_dataset.csv")

ggplot(completed_validation, aes(x=char16_length, y=edit_distance))+
  geom_point(aes(size=char_16_edist, color="First 16"), alpha=0.5)+
  geom_point(aes(size=third_edist, color="1/3 LCS"))+
  geom_abline(slope=0, intercept=16)+
  labs(x="First 16 Character Method Clean Note Length", y="FNC Edit Distance", size = "Error", color="Method")+
  scale_color_manual(values=c("black","yellow"))+
  theme_bw()


# include_graphics(path = "images/cleaningerror.jpg")
```


Here, the yellow circles indicate the FNC method with a 16 character threshold, while the black circles represent the LCS method with a threshold of 1/3 the previous character length.
Larger circles indicate a larger amount of error when compared to the hand-cleaned notes.
The y-axis shows the edit distance computed between the current and previous notes for the FNC method, while the x-axis indicates the length of the clean notes.
The horizontal line is the 16 character threshold for the FNC method.
As can be seen, most observations are located in the bottom left of the graph, below the FNC threshold, and have relatively small circles.
These are notes where the FNC method was effectively applied, meaning that the edit distance was small enough to remove duplicated text at the beginning of the document.
In the observations above the threshold, most have a larger error when the FNC method is applied compared to the LCS method, with the exception of one observation in the top left.
In that case, the error appeared to be equal for both methods.
There is also a larger FNC method error for the observation on the bottom right of the graph.
This was a case of duplicate text, resulting in abnormally long notes.
This graph shows that an edit distance above the FNC method's threshold and the length of the cleaned notes can be used as criterion for determining when the LCS method should be applied.
I chose to set a threshold of 4 standard deviations above the mean note length for cleaned notes of the page of interest to constitute "unusually long" notes to apply the LCS method to.
I chose 1/3 of the previous notes as the LCS threshold because the mean edit distance to the correct notes was comparable to the 1/4 + 5 character threshold, but it is more conservative for larger notes (as can be seen in Table \@ref(tab:cleancompare)).

```{r cleancompare, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
validation_table <- read.csv("data/validation_summary_table.csv")
study1_notes <- read.csv("data/study1_hybrid_dataset.csv")

val_table <- validation_table[,-1]
val_table$Time<- round(val_table$Time, 2)
val_table$Error<- round(val_table$Error, 2)
val_table$SD<- round(val_table$SD, 2)
colnames(val_table) <- c("Method", "Time (Minutes)", "Error", "SD")

kable(val_table, align=c('l','c','c','c'), caption="Note Cleaning Method Comparison")
```


The results of this study are shown in Table \@ref(tab:cleancompare).
Notably, the mean edit distance to the correct notes (or the error) is large for the FNC methods, with a high level of variation.
However, the computation time is between 3 and 8 minutes.
In the case of the LCS method, the error is much lower, but the computation time is above an hour, taking approximately 17 times as long as the FNC method.
The hybrid method combines the benefits of both of these methods. 
The error rate is on par with that of the LCS methods, while the time is only slightly above that of the FNC methods.
The flowchart in Figure \@ref(fig:flowchart) shows how this hybrid method will be applied to the case study dataset.

#### Full Dataset

On the complete dataset, the hybrid method took a total of 19.33 minutes to run. 
This demonstrates the time benefit of the hybrid method over the Longest Common Substring method - it took less time to clean the complete dataset with the hybrid method than it took to evaluate the reduced dataset with the LCS method. 
The data cleaning resulted in a total of `r format(sum(study1_notes$page_notes != "", na.rm=TRUE), big.mark = ",")` note pages with some text recorded.
This is much smaller than the uncleaned total of `r format(dim(unclean_reduced)[1], big.mark = ",")` note pages, demonstrating a significant reduction in the note size (as is expected when removing the previous page's notes).

```{r}
#| notecount,
#| fig.cap= "Number of Notes Taken Per Page",
#| fig.width= 7,
#| fig.align= "center",
#| echo= FALSE,
#| message= FALSE,

  facet_grid(algorithm~., labeller = label_both)+
  theme_bw()+
  xlab("Page Number")+
  ylab("Count")

```

Figure \@ref(fig:notecount) consists of the number of participants who took notes based on the page number.
In both the algorithm and the non-algorithm scenario, more individuals took notes on the first two pages of the testimony compared to the rest of the testimony.
However, the plot shows that individuals took notes throughout the testimony.

### Collocation Analysis

Table \@ref(tab:colcount) shows the highest frequencies for the second page of the testimony: 

"In this case the defendant Richard Cole has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. 
Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge. 
You will now hear a summary of the case.
This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk.
It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial."

```

The italicized collocations in Table \@ref(tab:colcount) show all of the collocations for the word "willfully" from the testimony above.
The frequencies for 'willfully' can be averaged: $\frac{121+93+91+76+75}{5}=91.2$.
This number will correspond to the shading of the word "willfully" in the highlighted testimony of Figure \@ref(fig:highlights).

Note that the words have a gradient.
This is to ensure a smooth transition between words in order to give an overall "highlight" effect, because we are interested in the important phrases in the testimony as opposed to the importance of individual words.

#### Fuzzy Matching

Table \@ref(tab:fuzzyexam) demonstrates fuzzy matches on the testimony description text mentioned previously.
With an edit distance of 1, it can be seen that these fuzzy matches are the result of simple typos - making it clear which transcript collocation the misspelled version corresponds to.
While most collocation misspellings in the table only occur a single time (recorded via the "Count" column), the last collocation occurs twice - indicating that two individual note takers missed an "l" in "willfully".
The "Collocation Matches" column indicates if the participant's collocation matches with multiple collocations from the study - such as "Jur" in the example above.

  arrange(-`Edit Distance`) %>%
    head(n=4) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Distant Fuzzy Matches from the Testimony")

# View(nonempty_reduced_comments)

```

\end{landscape}

Interestingly, when considering the most distant fuzzy matches in Table \@ref(tab:fuzzyexamlarge), these phrases do not come from simple typos, but rather from a non-testimony title portion of the study: "Jury Perception of Trial Information, Presentation, and Demonstrative Evidence", and may result from participants copying the entire web page into the note sheet.
Two individuals copied this title into their notes, but on different pages of the testimony.
The collocations in Table \@ref(tab:fuzzyexamlarge) correspond to the individual who copied the title on the second page of the testimony.
Because these phrases do not noticeably correspond to the transcript collocations, as shown in their larger edit distance, they are given less weight.
In this case, we also see that the participant collocation of "perception of trial information presentation" was an equal edit distance from two collocations, based on the "Collocation Matches" value.
Thus, the weight would be adjusted accordingly due to the presence of two close matches.

#### Standardization

The courtroom transcript testimony comes from a 2x2x3 factorial design (presence or absence of images, presence or absence of the algorithm, and the conclusion: identification, inconclusive, or elimination).
This standardization is included in Figure \@ref(fig:weightedhighlights).
In comparing with the unweighted highlighting without fuzzy matching of Figure \@ref(fig:highlights), the same pattern emerges in terms of phrase popularity: most individuals focused on the crime.
However, the numerical values of the gradient scale have changed.

```{r}
#| weightedhighlights,
#| fig.cap= "Highlighted Fuzzy Collocation for Page 2",
#| fig.width= 7,
#| fig.align= "center",
#| echo= FALSE,
#| message= FALSE,

### Final Output
This final note analysis, which includes fuzzy matching, can be found at https://rachelesrogers.github.io/Presentations/Collocations/Collocation%20Comment%20Analysis%20Cleaned.html.
In visually comparing the highlighted transcripts for fuzzy matches to those without fuzzy matching, the results appear to be fairly similar. 
While the fuzzy matching did increase the frequency number, the overall trends remained the same for the dataset.
This can be seen in Table \@ref(tab:nonfuzzycount).
The ranking of the collocations remains is similar, aside from differences that can be seen in collocations that had the same non-fuzzy count.
<!-- There is a jump in the fuzzy matches for the charge (a felony) that is not seen in the non-fuzzy matching. -->

<!-- : Table of Collocation Frequencies (\#tab:nonfuzzycount) -->

The standardized frequency values remain fairly consistent throughout the testimony.
Some areas that individuals focused on were the crime and its extent (in terms of injury), the qualifications/process of the firearms examiner, and the results from the analysis.
While this type of analysis may allow us to determine the areas that participants copied into their notes, it does not indicate why the participants found this testimony worth copying.
This may either indicate areas that participants saw as interesting or confusing, or a mixture of both.

## Discussion

### Conclusion

Overall, this process effectively cleans and displays notes with the desired highlight format.
For sequential notes, such as this case, the First N Character method manages to clean the notes in most cases.
In the cases where the FNC method is ineffective (when the edit distance is above the threshold or the clean notes are unusually long), the Longest Common Substring method can be applied.
This process was demonstrated in a dataset of 35 participants, and showed a significant note reduction on the full dataset.

After the notes are cleaned, collocations can be used to determine what phrases participants decided to copy into their notes.
The length of the collocation was chosen to be long enough to avoid commonly repeated phrases, but short enough that participants may directly copy the phrase into their notes.
Notes that were not directly copied were included with weights proportional to edit distance through the use of fuzzy matching.
The final output qualitatively indicates which portions of testimony participants found relevant to copy.

This method opens up new avenues for user studies and analyses.
While this method was developed for a specific use case, it has diverse applications, including education, social science, and more. 
These methods are being developed into R packages to be used by other
researchers in transcript analysis. 
Future studies may investigate the application of this notepad in a variety of scenarios, such as course notes or collaborative note
taking.
Another application of this type of analysis may be used in the evaluation of student note taking or Wikipedia article edits.
