# Text analysis with Transcripts {#textcolor}

- Participants of the first study were allowed to take notes while reading through the transcripts, which are saved by page number
- We would like to use this to highlight which parts of the testimonies the participants found to be important

- First attempt:
  - ggplot: allows for both a gradient and transparency to be added to words based on their frequency
  - graphing words of the transcript resulted in ugly spacing
  - Relative frequency was computed based on the number of times the word appeared on the page
- Second attempt:
  - Using LaTex instead of ggplot: can set gradient through color outputted by ggplot, but have not played with transparency
  - Words can be equally spaced
  - Currently assigning a new color to each word - this is not efficient
  - Needs to be in CSS for tab format of presenting the transcripts
  - Need to add labels for the gradient scale, because all pages will have a different legend
  - Change from relative frequency to a different type of frequency (review notes)
     - Cosine Frequency?
       - Jessica Recommended
     - Edit Distance?
       - Usually at the character level, not at the word level
       - Would need to determine what needs to be matched (I don't think most notes will be in nice sentence form)
