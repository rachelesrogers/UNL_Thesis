<p>The results from the initial study found in Chapter <a href="2-study1.html#study1">2</a> call into question the use of Likert response scales when evaluation jury perception of firearms experts, as well as the use of a transcript testimony format.</p>
<p>Responses pertaining to the credibility of the expert, as well as the reliability and scientificity of the evidence, suffered from scale compression when a Likert scale was used - participants indicated overall confidence in credibility, reliability, and scientificity by mainly selecting the two highest categories of each scale.
This lack of variation in scale responses makes it difficult to discern potential differences between treatment conditions.
Due to this difficulty, we conducted a micro study comparing various response types, in order to determine substitute questions that may be more sensitive to scenario differences.
Additional changes include the addition of jury instructions on the part of the judge, instructing members of the jury to treat the firearms examiner as they would any other witness and removing the use of the term “expert”.
Additional cross examination testimony with regards to the firearms examiner’s inability to specifically tie the defendant to the crime scene is included as well.
The transcript for the second study can be found in Appendix <a href="B-study-2-changes.html#study-2-changes">B</a>.</p>
<p>In the initial study, some participants were confused about who the witnesses were testifying for.
This may be due to the testimony format, which does not clearly identify the speaker with each line, instead using “Q:” and “A:” in most cases, as shown in Appendix <a href="B-study-2-changes.html#study-2-changes">B</a>.
This lack of visuals for tracking speakers is not representative of the courtroom setting, and may have contributed to the confusion expressed by a participant.
The transcript format may also lend an air of impartiality to the witnesses due to the relatively unclear identity of the individual asking the questions.
Due to this potential issue, we strove to develop a general tool that can be used in online courtroom studies to provide visual representation of relevant actors, making it easier to track speakers, and with versatility in terms of individual characteristics.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the chance of confounding typos as seen in Study 1, we used one master file with all lines of testimony, labelled by the scenario in which the testimony occurs.
Thus, there is no longer multiple files of repeated text.
We also use unique identification throughout the database files in the form of Prolific ID’s and a random number assigned to the participant instead of relying on unique fingerprints, so the demographics section can more easily be linked to the final results.</p>

<p>Appendix <a href="B-study-2-changes.html#study-2-changes">B</a> shows the characters that have been developed for this study, as well as a screenshot of the study format.
These characters were drawn so that the clothes and heads can be interchanged, providing a wide variety of characters for potential scenarios.
One difficulty in including drawn figures with realistic skin tones and figures is the influence of perceived race or gender on the participants’ judgements.
<span class="citation">Stanley, Sokol-Hessner, Banaji, &amp; Phelps (2011)</span> found a relationship between implicit racial bias and the perceived trustworthiness of individuals based on images of black and white males.
They also found that 80% of participants exhibited pro-white implicit bias.
Because of this potential bias introduced by visual figures, we plan to conduct a study in order to determine how these figures are perceived at a later time.
For the current study, the same figures are used consistently across all conditions to prevent a confounding effect.</p>
<p>To investigate a which response type may be most informative for this study and to troubleshoot the use of figures and speech bubble format, we conducted a smaller micro study using various response types.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Study Format<a href="4-study2.html#study-format-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Participants were presented with the same scenario described in Chapter <a href="2-study1.html#study1">2</a>: participants read a trial transcript regarding an attempted convenience store robbery, where the only evidence presented is a bullet comparison between the defendant’s gun and a bullet recovered from the scene of the crime (a scenario from <span class="citation">B. Garrett et al. (2020)</span>).
In this case, however, the only factor that was changed was the conclusion of the firearms examiner: either an indentification or exclusion.
In all conditions, the algorithm was absent and there were no images.
The testimony largely followed that of Chapter <a href="2-study1.html#study1">2</a>, aside from differences in the format and additional testimony described above.
In this case, it was also explicitly stated that the testimony did not reflect all evidence presented in the case, because in the exclusion condition there may not be enough evidence to bring the case to trial.</p>
<p>At the end of the testimony, the participants were asked a variety of questions regarding the strength of evidence in the case.
Questions of probability, strength of evidence, and decision to convict were repeated from the Chapter <a href="2-study1.html#study1">2</a> study.
Participants were asked to evaluate the probability that the defendant committed the crime, both with a visible probability scale (allowing the participants to select the exact probability integer) and with a non-visible scale (only the numbers of 0 and 100 were available on the extremes of the scale).
The strength of evidence was a Likert scale with values from “Not at all strong” to “Extremely strong” with nine points.
In terms of conviction, participants were reminded of the decision criterion of “beyond a reasonable doubt” when making a decision in a criminal trial, and asked if they would choose to convict.</p>
<p>New questions for this micro study asked individuals to give their opinion of the guilt of the defendant, as well as assessing the chances that the defendant committed the crime, how much they would be willing to bet that the defendant was either innocent or guilty, and their opinion of the defendant.
In addition to a question regarding whether or not the participant would choose to convict, we also asked the participants to give their personal opinion on the guilt of the defendant.
This provides a second threshold for assessing the strength of evidence, aside from the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard.
Two different questions were asked with regards to the chances that the defendant committed the crime.
One was in a multiple choice format, with extreme values of “Impossible to be guilty” and “Certain to be guilty”, and intermediate values ranging from “About 1 chance in 10,000” to “About 9,999 chances in 10,000” with denominator values changing by a decimal place for each choice, and a middle value of “1 chance in 2”.
This format was taken from <span class="citation">Thompson &amp; Newman (2015)</span>’s study of DNA, which consisted of larger scaled values in the denominator (up to 1 in 10 million).
The second question allowed participants to select both the numerator and denominator: “About ___ chance(s) in ___ that the defendant is (innocent/guilty)”, where participants were able to select to express the value as innocence or guilt.
In both cases, the numerator had to be less than or equal to the denominator.
Individuals who thought that the defendant was guilty were asked how much they were willing to bet that the defendant was guilty, if hypothetically researchers provided them with $50 and they would double their money if they were correct, and vice versa.
A final new question was open ended, and asked participants to provide their opinion of the defendant.</p>
<p>We first asked individuals to provide their opinion of the defendant, their conviction decision, and their personal opinion of the guilt of the defendant.
All other questions were randomized in a way that guaranteed the two probability questions and the two chance questions were not asked directly following each other.</p>

<p>Of the 306 completed surveys, 145 participants were men, 156 participants were women, and 5 participants identified as other or non-binary.
The median age category was 46 - 55.
Age and gender are shown in Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:demographics2">4.1</a>.
Individuals were asked a single attention check question with regards to the caliber of gun used in the attempted robbery.
299 participants passed the attention check, meaning that only 7 participants failed the attention check, and will not be included in the analysis.
There were 147 participants in the identification condition, and 152 participants in the elimination condition who passed the attention check.
We adjusted the probability of receiving each condition throughout the survey to ensure categories were relatively equal.</p>

<p>There were some procedurial changes made to this study compared to the original study that may influence results; namely, more detailed cross examination and the inclusion of jury instructions.
Another significant difference between the two studies is the time frame - notably, in this microstudy, a participant commented that they had recently read an article about the unreliability of firearms evidence.
More widespread criticism of firearms examination may lead to lower feelings of reliability.</p>
<p>In both studies, participants are asked if they would choose to convict, given the “beyond a reasonable doubt” threshold.
In this study, 54.42% (or 80 out of 147) individuals who received the identification condition chose to convict, while 4.61% (or 7 out of 152) participants who received the elimination condition chose to convict.
The conviction percentage for the identification condition in this study is slightly lower than the comparable condition in the original study (without the use of the algorithm and images): 61.82 (or 34 out of 55).
However, there is not a significant difference between studies (p-value 0.43).
None of the 49 individuals in the original study who received the elimination condition without the use of the algorithm or images chose to convict.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:strength2">4.2</a> shows participant responses to the strength of evidence in this study.
As can be seen, those in the elimination category tended to choose the smallest value for the strength of evidence (“Not at all strong”), while in the case of the identification condition, individuals tended to distribute their views of the strength of evidence more evenly.
This graph resembles the strength of evidence results from the initial study, shown in Figure <a href="2-study1.html#fig:strength">2.17</a>.
While not as dramatic as the scale compression for questions of reliability, credibility, and scientificity, the elimination results for strength of evidence do appear to show a scale limitation in the way that individuals tended to select the lowest category.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:prob2">4.3</a> demonstrates the participants’ selected probabilities that the defendant committed the crime.
As in the case of the strength of evidence, the graph resembles the probability graph found in the initial study (Figure <a href="2-study1.html#fig:probalgorithm">2.6</a>), where there is a higher peak of extreme values for the elimination conditions than for the identification condition.
When using a t-test to compare the mean visible probabilities for the identification and elimination condition to those comparable conditions of the initial study, there is not a significant difference for the identification condition, but is a significant difference in the elimination condition (p-values of 0.15 and 0.01, respectively).
The estimated mean is higher in this follow up study (17.11) than the initial study (9.98) in the elimination condition.
For the identification condition, the estimated probabilities are 74.52 for the follow-up study and 79.78 for the initial study.
In this study, there does not appear to be a difference in the density curves based on the visibility of the probability scale.</p>

<p>In addition to asking participants if they would choose to convict, participants were also asked about their opinion of the guilt of the defendant.
In this case, 74.15% (or 109 out of 147) individuals who received the identification condition thought the defendant was guilty, while 4.61% (or 7 out of 152) participants who received the elimination condition thought the defendant was guilty.
Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:opinionguilt">4.4</a> shows the comparison between the participant’s decision to convict and their personal opinion.
Approximately half of the participant in the identification condition who chose not to convict thought the defendant was in fact guilty.
This indicates that participants have different thresholds for their personal opinion of guilt compared to the “beyond a reasonable doubt” threshold.
Of the 80 individuals who chose to convict in the identification condition, 5 participants thought the defendant was in fact innocent.
This discrepancy may be due to participants reversing the strength of the thresholds - they feel that the evidence is strong enough to convict, but are not wholly convinced.</p>

Figure 4.4: Comparison of opinions of guilt and choice to convict

<p>Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:betting">4.5</a> indicates how much participants said they would be willing to bet that the defendant was either guilty or innocent, if provided with $50.
If the participant indicated that they thought the defendant was innocent, they were asked how much they would be willing to bet that the defendant was innocent, and vice versa.
This figure indicates that most people who thought Cole was innocent in the elimination condition were willing to bet the full amount (84 out of 141 participants).
It also appears that people tended to select values multiples of 5 (284 out of 299, with 8 additional individuals selecting 0).
Those in the identification condition selected less extreme values (for both those who thought the defendant was guilty and those who thought the defendant was innocent) than what is seen in those with the elimination condition who thought the defendant was innocent.
In this way, the betting response is similar both to the strength of evidence response and the probability of committing the crime response.</p>

</div>
<p>The remaining questions relate to the chance that the defendant committed the crime.
One question, shown in Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:fixedlike">4.6</a>, allowed participants to select the chance that the defendant committed the crime from a multiple choice scale.
Because the scale includes both extreme values that favor innocence and guilt, this question remained the same regardless of the participant’s opinion on the guilt of the defendant.
This scale does not provide a linear distance between intervals, but instead changes by multiples of 10 in the denominator (ex. one category is 1 in 10, and the next category is 1 in 100).
The exceptions are the endpoints, which are “Impossible to be guilty” and “Certain to be guilty”, as well as the midpoint of 1 chance in 2.
In this case, the scale in the elimination condition does not encounter the ceiling or floor effect that has been seen in previous scales, as participants did not overwhelmingly select the lowest value.
Instead, participants are distributed mainly throughout the lower half of the scale, while those in the match condition tended to be a little closer to the center.
In both cases, participants are not crowded into a small number of categories.
Thus, the multiple choice chance scale appears to have less scale compression than seen previously in the other response types.
This wider distribution may be the result of decompressing the end points - individuals have a variety of values to select that reflect their judgement of a low probability that the defendant committed the crime, or a low strength of evidence.</p>

</div>
<p>A final question asks individuals to provide a numerical chance that the defendant is either innocent or guilty, depending on the participants’ choice.
Their responses were limited so that the numerator was smaller than the denominator, resulting in a range of values from 0 to 1, in most cases.
There were 3 responses with values greater than 1 that will not be considered in this analysis.
These results are shown in Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:freelike">4.7</a>.
As seen in previous graphs, in the case of the elimination condition, individuals gave small values for the chance that the defendant had in fact committed the crime, resulting in a sharp peak.
Alternatively, individuals were less extreme when they expressed their opinion as the chance that the defendant did not commit the crime.
In the case of the identification condition, those who expressed their opinions as either guilt or innocence gave similar results, resulting in symmetry between the two distributions.
As shown in Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:opinionchanceplot">4.8</a>, those who thought the defendant was innocent were more likely to favor inputting chance values in terms of innocence, while those who thought the defendant was guilty showed no clear preference.
The default value of the question is “innocent”, with the option of switching to “guilty”.</p>

<p>Consistency across response types is another important aspect of this study.
If different question types result in responses that are inconsistent, it would be difficult to tell which questions truly capture the attitudes of the participants, in order to most accurately answer the research questions.
As mentioned in the previous literature review, there have been studies to suggest that individuals may struggle with the interpretation of chance scales.
Questions of how much a participant is willing to bet may also depend on their personal feel for risk, and betting hypothetical money may have different results than betting real money, or betting money for someone else.
Because individuals may be influenced by which scale they see first, the order of the questions were randomized and recorded, so that the orders can be compared.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:likecomp1">4.9</a> shows the comparison of the multiple choice chance responses to the numeric chance responses, in the case that the participants thought the defendant was innocent.
Because these individuals thought that the defendant was innocent, there are few responses higher than a “fifty-fifty chance”.
The red dots represent the actual value represented by the multiple choice chance (for example, the red dot for “About 1 chance in 10” is located at the y-value of 0.10).
This allows for comparison on the consistency between the multiple choice and the numeric scales.
For values of “1 chance in 2” and “About 1 chance in 10”, the responses seem fairly consistent - however, it is difficult to tell if these values are consistent for smaller values, because they are seen as small on the linear scale.</p>

<p>This transformation is shown in Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:likecomp1scale">4.10</a>.
From this transformed scale, there still appears to be consistency between when participants choose their own chance numerically and when they were offered a multiple choice.
There does, however, appear to be a difference in those who selected “Impossible that he is guilty” from the multiple choice scale.
Many of the numerical responses appear to be more consistent to “About 1 chance in 10,000” than the value of 0 that would indicate impossibility.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>This same procedure can be repeated for those who thought the defendant was guilty, as shown in Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:likecomp2">4.11</a>.
In this case, because individuals who thought the defendant was guilty were asked to supply the chance that the defendant did not commit the crime, their numerical chance was changed to the chance that the defendant did commit the crime by subtracting their provided chance estimate from 1.
In a reverse of the chance for those who thought Cole was innocent, in this case most responses are at or above “1 chance in 2”.
Even without a transformation, it can be seen that there is a large spread of those who selected “Certain to be guilty”, and that those who selected “fifty-fifty chance” tended to select higher chances of guilt when they were free to choose their own response, while those who selected “About 9 chances in 10” tended to align well between the numerical and multiple choice options.</p>
<p>The reduced consistency seen in the guilty chance may related to the change in the question wording, where the multiple choice question considers the chance of guilt, while their numeric chance considered the chance of innocence.</p>

<p>Similar to the figures above, a comparison graph can be made to compare the multiple choice chance values to the probability scales.
This scale comparison is shown in Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:likeprob">4.12</a>.
In the case of the probabilities, individuals were only able to select integers between 0 and 100, meaning that this scale would not translate to the more extreme values of the multiple choice chance scale (outside of the values of “About 1 in 100” and “About 99 in 100”).
For values that can map from the probability scale to the chance scale, the values appear to be more spread out than those in the numerical chance scale, and those who selected “About 1 chance in 10” on the multiple choice scale tended to select larger chances.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:likeprobcon">4.13</a> shows a comparison of the perceived probability that the defendant committed the crime compared to the perceived chance that the defendant is guilty.
In the case of the match condition, it can be seen that many individuals assigned a high probability that the defendant committed the crime which corresponded to a high chance of guilt, as shown by the cluster of observations in the top right corner of the graph.
Similarly, in the non-match condition, many individuals gave a low probability that the individual committed the crime and a low chance that the defendant was guilty.
The correlation between the probability and the chances of guilt is 0.9,
while the correlation between the probability and the chances of innocence is -0.69.
While there is a fairly strong correlation in the case of chances of guilt and probability, the correlation between the probability and the chances of innocence is weaker.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:likeconvict">4.14</a> demonstrates the relationship between likelihood, probability, and the decision to convict.
In the non-match case, few individuals chose to convict.
In the match condition, those who chose to convict selected a probability above 50%, and tended to select values in the top right corner, which appears to be consistent with their conviction choice.
The clustering of values at around 1 on the chance scale may be due to compression in higher numbers, much like what was seen on the multiple choice question.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:coordstrcat">4.15</a> shows the relationship between individuals’ ratings of the strength of evidence, and the categorical selection of the chance that the defendant committed the crime.
The left graph is for the non-match condition, while the right graph is for the match condition.
Both strength of evidence and the chances of committing the crime have weaker/less of a chance of committing the crime on the bottom, and stronger/more chance of committing the crime at the top.
In the case of the match condition, individuals in the strength condition selected various values for the chance that the defendant committed the crime, indicating that participants do not interpret the chances of committing the crime as the same amount of strength of evidence uniformly.
In the case of the match condition, most individuals chose the smallest level for the strength of evidence.
While most participants in the lowest category of the strength of evidence marked “About 1 chance in 10,000” that the defendant committed the crime, many participants also selected values between “Impossible that he is guilty” and “About 1 chance in 100”.
Indeed, the second most popular chance category for those who chose the weakest strength of evidence is “About 1 chance in 100”, which is also the most popular chance category for those who chose the second weakest strength of evidence.
Based on these graphs, there does not appear to be consensus on how the strength of evidence translates to the chance that the defendant committed the crime.
Because of the variety of responses in the chance that the defendant committed the crime, it appears that it may be the better method for recording responses.</p>

<p>In their study, <span class="citation">Thompson et al. (2013)</span> compared the given chances that the defendant committed a crime to the decision to convict, and found a threshold of about 9 chances in 10, where participants who selected 9 chances in 10 or a higher chance amount were more likely to select a guilty verdict, while those below 9 chances in 10 were more likely to select a not guilty verdict.
Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:convictlike">4.16</a> depicts the results for our study.
Here, participants cross the threshold of being more likely to convict when they select “About 99 chances in 100” in the match condition, or “About 999 chances in 1,000” in the non-match condition.
This threshold is one category larger than what was seen by <span class="citation">Thompson et al. (2013)</span>.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:opinionlike">4.17</a> demonstrates the relationship between the chance scale and the participant’s opinion of the guilt of the defendant.
In this case, individuals thought the defendant committed the crime if they were above the “fifty-fifty chance” value for the match condition, showing a lower threshold for their opinion of guilt than seen in Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:convictlike">4.16</a>, when they were asked for their conviction choice.
Individuals who selected the “fifty-fifty chance” appear to be fairly evenly split on their opinion of the guilt of the defendant in the match condition.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:probcomp">4.18</a> shows the correspondence between the visible and hidden probabilities.
The values appear to be fairly 1:1.
In the case of the match condition, there appears to be a congregation of values at 90% when the scale is visible.
This is also reflected in the non-match condition, where there is a group of observations at 10%.
Otherwise, the observations appear to correspond fairly well.
The correlation between the probabilities is 0.98, indicating a strong relationship.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:probbet">4.19</a> compares the amount that individuals were willing to bet to their assigned probability that the defendant had committed the crime.
In this case, there is not a straightforward correspondence.
The correlation is 0.58 in the case that the participants were asked to bet on if the defendant committed the crime, and -0.57 when participants were asked to bet on if the defendant did not commit the crime (where the betting procedure is as explained earlier).
This correlation is lower than seen between probability and the chance of committing the crime when both of the chances were combined.</p>

<p><span class="citation">Mattijssen et al. (2020)</span> compared likelihood and strength of evidence ratings from 10 examiners who regularly used likelihood scales.
While this sample size is rather small, they found that examiners tended to give higher verbal degrees of support than they should have, based on their likelihood ratio.
A similar effect can be investigated in the potential jurors of this study, when asked to rate the strength of evidence in the case as compared to their perceived probability that the defendant committed the crime.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:strengthprob">4.20</a> shows the relationship between the strength of evidence compared to the probability that the defendant committed the crime.
In the match condition, there is a generally increasing correspondence between the perceived strength of evidence and the participants’ predicted probability that the defendant committed the crime.
This corresponsence is less clear in the non-match condition.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:probincome">4.21</a> explores a potential relationship between income and believed probability that the defendant committed the crime.

<p>Bases on Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:convictsincome">4.22</a>, some individuals in the match condition chose to convict across all income levels.
There does not appear to be a clear trend between conviction choice and income.
While two income amounts ($30,000 - $39,999 and $100,000 - $149,999) consisted of individuals who chose to convict more than they chose not to convict, this trend is not demonstrated in any other income categories.
In the case of the non-match condition, the individuals who did choose to convict came from different income brackets.</p>

<p>One may expect income to make a difference in how much individuals choose to bet on their opinion in the case, either in the amount of risk an individual is willing to take or in their desire to keep hypothetical money.
This does not appear to be the case, however, based on Figure <a href="4-study2.html#fig:incomebet">4.23</a>.
As discussed earlier, many participants in the non-match condition were willing to bet the full amount that the defendant was innocent.
This is reflected across most income categories as well.
In the case of the match condition, we saw earlier that participants were not as extreme in their bets as is seen in the non-match condition.
This trend is also reflected in the boxplots, with a fairly similar distribution of both the innocent and guilty bets across all income categories.</p>
