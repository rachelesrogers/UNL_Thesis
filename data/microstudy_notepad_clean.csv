Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

 Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet. 
 Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. ","NoMatch",131

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge. Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. ","Match",33

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge. Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel.

A man went into a convenience store and fired a shot then demanded money. he left without money and no one was hurt. the employee didnt get a close look at the robber bc he had on a ski mask. as she was getting money, she pressed a hidden alarm which scared the robber. a 9mm bullet was collected for forensic analysis. two days later, a police officer did a traffic stop on richard cole for speeding. during the search, the cop located the 9mm handgun which was legally registered to him, but bc it was the same used as the one in the robbery, it was confiscated for testing. richard was arrested and charged with firing a gun in a business. 

terry smith(firearm examiner for 7 years) testifies. they look at cartdige cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a specific gun. ""I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners"" the police department is  accredited by ASCLID/LAB. terry was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.she examined how many lands and grooves the bullet had. that means ""Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet."" ""Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right."" The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

terry: ""In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet. Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence. It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.""she compared the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?

her conclusion: ""I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel."" she concluded that by ""I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement.

terry smith - examiner - asclid lab 7 years experience -Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet

I found that there was significant disagreement in individual characteristics
In this case, the accidental, random marks on the bullets from the firing process were substantially different - enough so to conclude that the two bullets were likely fired from different guns.

I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners
accredited by ASCLID/LAB
In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet
I found that there was significant disagreement in individual characteristics
In this case, the accidental, random marks on the bullets from the firing process were substantially different - enough so to conclude that the two bullets were likely fired from different guns.

My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from different firearms. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false negative identification rate is less than three percent. I believe it's about 2.5 to 2.9. That's just a general number that's out there

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.
The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask. As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, wich was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing.

And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.his bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right  The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.  In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.  Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot.

It also had six lands, and twisted to the right. compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope.  I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.  I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.  I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next","Match",247

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.
The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask. As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, wich was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant.

Is the local police department lab accredited?
Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

What work did you do on this case?
I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
Yes.

Can you explain for the jury what that means?
Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.

But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
Yes, I did.

You will now read a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes select evidence that was presented at trial.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Hello
Hi

Would you raise your right hand for me?
Do you swear the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, under penalty of perjury?
I do.

Please be seated. State your full name for the record and spell your last name.
My name is Terry Smith, last name S-m-i-t-h.

Who do you work for?
The local police department.

What do you do for the police department?
I am a firearms examiner.

How long have you been doing that?
7 years

What is a firearms examiner?
A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an opinion witness in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Any cross on their credentials?
No, Your Honor.
This witness is an opinion witness in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.


What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Is the local police department lab accredited?
Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

What work did you do on this case?
I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
Yes.

Can you explain for the jury what that means?
Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
Yes, I did.

What is your conclusion?
I found that there was significant disagreement in individual characteristics.

How were you able to conclude that?
I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.

When I see disagreement in multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having significant disagreement.

Now, are you telling the jury today that when one firearm fires two bullets, the individual markings are so similar that you can say that they were fired from a single gun?
Yes, when there is significant similarity, the likelihood that two different guns could have made the mark is so remote as to be considered a practical impossibility.

So that is not what you observed in this case?
In this case, the accidental, random marks on the bullets from the firing process were substantially different - enough so to conclude that the two bullets were likely fired from different guns.

How many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
I'd say thousands.

And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
Yes, I did.

Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
Yes.

That's what we call peer review?
Peer review, yes.

---Cross Examination---

You have a criterion in your head, a subjective criterion, of what will constitute an identification. Is that correct?
Yes.

All right. If we brought three more people in, would their subjective criterion in their head be identical to yours?
They would look for that same sufficient agreement. However, based on their training and experience on difficult comparisons, they may or may not come to the same decision.

Right. But they also could reach the same decision but have a different subjective criterion than you. Is that fair?
They may, possibly. I don't know. I can't speak for other examiners.

I understand, but that's the nature of being subjective, right?
Right.

Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value.

You can't tell us anything about who shot the firearm, correct?
That is correct.

And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
Yes, I did.

Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
Yes.

That's what we call peer review?
Peer review, yes.

Thank you, no further questions.

---Cross Examination---

You have a criterion in your head, a subjective criterion, of what will constitute an identification. Is that correct?
Yes.

All right. If we brought three more people in, would their subjective criterion in their head be identical to yours?
They would look for that same sufficient agreement. However, based on their training and experience on difficult comparisons, they may or may not come to the same decision.

Right. But they also could reach the same decision but have a different subjective criterion than you. Is that fair?
They may, possibly. I don't know. I can't speak for other examiners.

I understand, but that's the nature of being subjective, right?
Right.

Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value.

You can't tell us anything about who shot the firearm, correct?
That is correct.


---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from a different firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from different firearms. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false negative identification rate is less than three percent. I believe it's about 2.5 to 2.9. That's just a general number that's out there

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now read a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes select evidence that was presented at trial.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.


Your next witness, please
The People would call Terry Smith.
Hello
Hi

Would you raise your right hand for me?
Do you swear the testimony you're about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, under penalty of perjury?
I do.

Please be seated. State your full name for the record and spell your last name.
My name is Terry Smith, last name S-m-i-t-h.

Who do you work for?
The local police department.

What do you do for the police department?
I am a firearms examiner.

How long have you been doing that?
7 years

What is a firearms examiner?
A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an opinion witness in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Any cross on their credentials?
No, Your Honor.
This witness is an opinion witness in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.


What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Is the local police department lab accredited?
Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

What work did you do on this case?
I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
Yes.

Can you explain for the jury what that means?
Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
Yes, I did.

What is your conclusion?
I found that there was significant disagreement in individual characteristics.

How were you able to conclude that?
I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.

When I see disagreement in multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having significant disagreement.

Now, are you telling the jury today that when one firearm fires two bullets, the individual markings are so similar that you can say that they were fired from a single gun?
Yes, when there is significant similarity, the likelihood that two different guns could have made the mark is so remote as to be considered a practical impossibility.

So that is not what you observed in this case?
In this case, the accidental, random marks on the bullets from the firing process were substantially different - enough so to conclude that the two bullets were likely fired from different guns.

How many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
I'd say thousands.

And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
Yes, I did.

Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
Yes.

That's what we call peer review?
Peer review, yes.

Thank you, no further questions.

---Cross Examination---

You have a criterion in your head, a subjective criterion, of what will constitute an identification. Is that correct?
Yes.

All right. If we brought three more people in, would their subjective criterion in their head be identical to yours?
They would look for that same sufficient agreement. However, based on their training and experience on difficult comparisons, they may or may not come to the same decision.

Right. But they also could reach the same decision but have a different subjective criterion than you. Is that fair?

No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.
Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. 

Terry Smith
firearms examiner for police, 7 yrs
 I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Is the local police department lab accredited?
Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB. 

 This witness is an opinion witness in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead. 

This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right.

 What is your conclusion?
I found that there was significant disagreement in individual characteristics. 

 I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.

When I see disagreement in multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having significant disagreement.
 In this case, the accidental, random marks on the bullets from the firing process were substantially different - enough so to conclude that the two bullets were likely fired from different guns.

Defense introduces idea that examiners use subjective or different criteria from each other. Asks about fixed numerical values to get to Sufficient Agreement. Terry says can't speak to what other examiners use as their criteria. Thinks they'd be able to find sufficient agreement. Thinks their training and experience = may or may not come to the same conclusions. Defense points out that this science can't tell anything about who shot the firearm.

Terry Smith, the expert firearms witness, seems to have relevant education, work experience, and continuing education. Works in accredited lab = ASCLID/LAB. Defense does not object to expert credentials.
Prosecution asks witness to describe lands and grooves, other ID concepts like twisting left or right, using test bullets from recovered gun. Examiner found microscopic levels details. Found ""significant disagreemnt in individual characteristics."" When questioned further, ""marks on the bullets from the firing process were substantially different - enough to conclude that the 2 bullets were likely fired from different guns."" Details about explosion process, how all show some differences. Explains he wrote up a report. Report went to peer review per department protocol.
Defense introduces idea that examiners use subjective or different criteria from each other. Asks about fixed numerical values to get to Sufficient Agreement. Terry says can't speak to what other examiners use as their criteria. Thinks they'd be able to find sufficient agreement. Thinks their training and experience = may or may not come to the same conclusions. Defense points out that this science can't tell anything about who shot the firearm.
Judge relays question from the jury about %accuracy of this science. Also, are you 100% sure?
Terry: 100% sure that bullets were from different firearms. Thinks the false negative error margin for examiners is less than 3%.

A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.
I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves.

Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.
I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel
I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet
Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.
The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop
Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.
I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel
I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.
Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?  Peer review, yes.

A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.
I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves.

No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism.

Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.

In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet
pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

What is your conclusion?
I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

How were you able to conclude that?
I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.

Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.

In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet
pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

What is your conclusion?
I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

How were you able to conclude that?
I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.

Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.","Match",280

Summary prepared by an objective court clerk, describes select evidence that was presented at trial.

911 to police: a man entered the store, producing a firearm and firing a shot into the ceiling before demanding money (though he left the store before receiving any and there were no injuries from the gunshot).

Store clerk: Testified that she could not make a facial identification of the suspect since he was wearing a ski mask. Press a hidden alarm button and the alarm bells caused the robber to panic and leave.

Detective: Testified that he went to the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. He also recovered the 9mm bullet from the store's ceiling and it was collected for forensic analysis.

Richard Cole, the defendant, was pulled over for speeding by a police officer two days later. The detective located a 9mm handgun, legally licensed to the defendant, during a search of the defendant's vehicle. As this gun was of the same caliber as the gun used in the attempted robbery, it was confiscated for testing. This led to the defendant's arrest and to him being charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Following transcript of Terry Smith's (firearms examiner) testimony:

-Sworn in
-7 years experience
-looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm
-received a bachelor's degree in forensic science. I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit in 2015. 
-underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners
-toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced
-attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners
-has undergone annual proficiency examinations
-local police department lab accredited by ASCLID/LAB
-no cross-examination on credentials by defense
-asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop
-examined how many lands and grooves the bullet had
-counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist; bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right
-test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop
-First compared personal test shot to test shot, looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Then compared the shot to the fired evidence
-number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires: six lands, twisted to the right like the fired evidence
-compared the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope
-found that there was significant disagreement in individual characteristic
-when one firearm fires two bullets, the individual markings are so similar that it can be said that they were fired from a single gun
-when there is significant similarity, the likelihood that two different guns could have made the mark is so remote as to be considered a practical impossibility
-but in this case, the accidental, random marks on the bullets from the firing process were substantially different - enough so to conclude that the two bullets were likely fired from different guns

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant.

 In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel.

When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism.

What work did you do on this case?
I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
Yes.

Can you explain for the jury what that means?
Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?

Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.

A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Is the local police department lab accredited?


Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB


What work did you do on this case?
I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
Yes.

Can you explain for the jury what that means?
Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?

Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.

How many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
I'd say thousands.

And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
Yes, I did.

Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
Yes.

That's what we call peer review?
Peer review, yes.

The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

---Cross Examination---

You have a criterion in your head, a subjective criterion, of what will constitute an identification. Is that correct?
Yes.

All right. If we brought three more people in, would their subjective criterion in their head be identical to yours?
They would look for that same sufficient agreement. However, based on their training and experience on difficult comparisons, they may or may not come to the same decision.

Right. But they also could reach the same decision but have a different subjective criterion than you. Is that fair?
They may, possibly. I don't know. I can't speak for other examiners.

I understand, but that's the nature of being subjective, right?
Right.

No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value.
