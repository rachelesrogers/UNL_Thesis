"In this study you will read a description of a criminal case and give your opinions about it. 
Although it is based on a real case, some of the facts (and all of the names) have been changed 
for the purposes of the study.</br></br>
As when listening to testimony, you will not be able to go back.
Please use the notepad to keep track of relevant information."

"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm 
in a place of business. This crime is a felony. </br></br>
Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge. </br></br>
You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. 
It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial."

"Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, 
pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving 
the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot. </br></br>
The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face 
to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.</br></br>
As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm 
and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store. </br></br>
Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective 
recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis. </br></br>
Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, 
the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber 
as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested 
and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business."
