Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

39,9,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail.

39,11,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

terry smith:
Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.


Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match.

39,12,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.


Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.


Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.

39,13,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun.

A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

terry smith:
Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.


Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.


Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.


Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis.

Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis.

Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

39,17,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

terry smith:
Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.


Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.


Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.


Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

DR ADRIAN JONES

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.


Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis.

Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.
A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1.

These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.

Q: Have you tested this algorithm?
A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners' visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1.

These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.

Q: Have you tested this algorithm?
A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners' visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

39,18,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

terry smith:
Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.


Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.


Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.


Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.


Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis.

Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.
A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1.

lands and grooves explanation (grip & spin bullet), imperfections specific to each gun



What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.","lands and grooves explanation (grip & spin bullet), imperfections specific to each gun

testimony of Terry Smith: 7 years working for police as firearms examiner, BS in forensics, experienced, proficient, no cross exam

lands and grooves explanation (grip & spin bullet), imperfections specific to each gun



What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.",169,"defendant Richard Cole charged with willfully discharging firearm in place of business

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.
Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

368,8,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

368,10,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?

A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.

Take Case Notes Here
In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

368,11,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

fired_bullet


---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

Take Case Notes Here
In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

368,12,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.

But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.

368,13,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

test_fire
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

microscope
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

test_fire
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

Take Case Notes Here
In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

368,14,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

Take Case Notes Here
In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

microscope
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

Take Case Notes Here
In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.
Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.
---Exhibit F---

shoulder
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.
Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.
---Exhibit F---

shoulder
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.






",6,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.






","Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the  shoulders  , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.

368,17,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

test_fire
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.
Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.
---Exhibit F---

shoulder
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Testimony

A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1. Exhibit G shows two matching signatures, while Exhibit H shows two non-matching signatures.
---Exhibit G---

signature

---Exhibit H---

These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.

Q: Have you tested this algorithm?
A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners' visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?

Take Case Notes Here
In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.
Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.
---Exhibit F---

shoulder
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Testimony

A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1. Exhibit G shows two matching signatures, while Exhibit H shows two non-matching signatures.
---Exhibit G---

signature

---Exhibit H---

signature
These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.

Q: Have you tested this algorithm?
A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners' visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.
Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.
---Exhibit F---

shoulder
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Testimony

A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1. Exhibit G shows two matching signatures, while Exhibit H shows two non-matching signatures.
---Exhibit G---

---Exhibit H---

These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.

Q: Have you tested this algorithm?
A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners' visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

368,18,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.
Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.
---Exhibit F---

shoulder
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Testimony

A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1. Exhibit G shows two matching signatures, while Exhibit H shows two non-matching signatures.
---Exhibit G---

signature

---Exhibit H---

signature
These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.

Q: Have you tested this algorithm?
A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners' visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

Q: Can this algorithm be used on 9mm bullets fired from a Ruger LCP firearm, such as the firearm in question for this case?
A: Yes, this algorithm can be used on these types of bullets, given that this type of firearm marks well.

Q: Has this algorithm been published?
A: Yes. The algorithm and its process have been discussed in peer reviewed journals such as Law, Probability, and Risk , The Annals of Applied Statistics , and Forensic Science International . The algorithm is also open source, which means that the full source code, documentation, and numerical weights are available online for anyone to examine.

",1658432371,10,Match,Yes,Yes,1658432601,24746,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1. Exhibit G shows two matching signatures, while Exhibit H shows two non-matching signatures.

These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.

Q: Have you tested this algorithm?
A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners' visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

Q: Can this algorithm be used on 9mm bullets fired from a Ruger LCP firearm, such as the firearm in question for this case?
A: Yes, this algorithm can be used on these types of bullets, given that this type of firearm marks well.

Q: Has this algorithm been published?
A: Yes. The algorithm and its process have been discussed in peer reviewed journals such as Law, Probability, and Risk , The Annals of Applied Statistics , and Forensic Science International . The algorithm is also open source, which means that the full source code, documentation, and numerical weights are available online for anyone to examine.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.
Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.
---Exhibit F---

shoulder
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Testimony

A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1. Exhibit G shows two matching signatures, while Exhibit H shows two non-matching signatures.

When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.

Q: Have you tested this algorithm?
A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners' visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail.

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Take Case Notes Here
In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony. Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.
Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.
Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.
---Exhibit F---

shoulder
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Testimony

A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1. Exhibit G shows two matching signatures, while Exhibit H shows two non-matching signatures.
---Exhibit G---

signature

---Exhibit H---

signature
These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.

Q: Have you tested this algorithm?
A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners' visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

Q: Can this algorithm be used on 9mm bullets fired from a Ruger LCP firearm, such as the firearm in question for this case?
A: Yes, this algorithm can be used on these types of bullets, given that this type of firearm marks well.

Q: Has this algorithm been published?
A: Yes. The algorithm and its process have been discussed in peer reviewed journals such as Law, Probability, and Risk , The Annals of Applied Statistics , and Forensic Science International . The algorithm is also open source, which means that the full source code, documentation, and numerical weights are available online for anyone to examine.

---Cross Examination---

Q: How long has the bullet matching algorithm been used in court cases?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: This algorithm requires some decision making on the part of the operator, such as how much the signature is smoothed and what part of the bullets are inputted into the system, correct?
A: Yes, there are certain parameters which must be specified, but the system defaults are usually sufficient and have been validated with a number of different firearms and ammunition types. There are also operating protocols for determining which parts of the bullet are scanned, so while this process is manual, there are clear criteria and the associated variability from scanning is well understood, and published in Forensic Science International .

Q: Can this algorithm be applied to all bullets?
A: No, the algorithm only works on traditionally rifled bullets which are largely undamaged. The algorithm has not been validated to work on seriously damaged or fragmented bullets.

I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.
Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.
Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.
---Exhibit F---

shoulder
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Testimony

A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1. Exhibit G shows two matching signatures, while Exhibit H shows two non-matching signatures.
---Exhibit G---

signature

---Exhibit H---

signature
These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.

Q: Have you tested this algorithm?
A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners' visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

Q: Can this algorithm be used on 9mm bullets fired from a Ruger LCP firearm, such as the firearm in question for this case?
A: Yes, this algorithm can be used on these types of bullets, given that this type of firearm marks well.

Q: Has this algorithm been published?
A: Yes. The algorithm and its process have been discussed in peer reviewed journals such as Law, Probability, and Risk , The Annals of Applied Statistics , and Forensic Science International . The algorithm is also open source, which means that the full source code, documentation, and numerical weights are available online for anyone to examine.

---Cross Examination---

Q: How long has the bullet matching algorithm been used in court cases?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: This algorithm requires some decision making on the part of the operator, such as how much the signature is smoothed and what part of the bullets are inputted into the system, correct?
A: Yes, there are certain parameters which must be specified, but the system defaults are usually sufficient and have been validated with a number of different firearms and ammunition types. There are also operating protocols for determining which parts of the bullet are scanned, so while this process is manual, there are clear criteria and the associated variability from scanning is well understood, and published in Forensic Science International .

Q: Can this algorithm be applied to all bullets?
A: No, the algorithm only works on traditionally rifled bullets which are largely undamaged. The algorithm has not been validated to work on seriously damaged or fragmented bullets.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

440,7,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

",2," What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel.

440,9,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.


Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.
Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that the class characteristics of the two bullets were the same, but there was not sufficient agreement among the individual characteristics. My comparison was inconclusive.

A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.

Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

440,10,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.


Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that the class characteristics of the two bullets were the same, but there was not sufficient agreement among the individual characteristics. My comparison was inconclusive.


Q: How did you arrive at that decision?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. When there is not strong agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as inconclusive. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.34.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is not sufficient agreement between the two bullets, which suggests that the results are inconclusive. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

440,11,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.


Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.
Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that the class characteristics of the two bullets were the same, but there was not sufficient agreement among the individual characteristics. My comparison was inconclusive.


Q: How did you arrive at that decision?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. When there is not strong agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as inconclusive.

The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.34.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is not sufficient agreement between the two bullets, which suggests that the results are inconclusive. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.
Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that the class characteristics of the two bullets were the same, but there was not sufficient agreement among the individual characteristics. My comparison was inconclusive.


Q: How did you arrive at that decision?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. When there is not strong agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as inconclusive. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.34.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is not sufficient agreement between the two bullets, which suggests that the results are inconclusive. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.
Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that when one firearm fires two bullets, the individual markings are so similar that you can say that they were fired from a single gun?
A: Yes, when there is significant similarity, the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: So that is not what you observed in this case?
A: In this case, while the class markings were consistent, there was not significant similarity among the individual characteristics - leading to an inconclusive determination.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, there is not a firm conclusion associated with values between 0.3 and 0.8.

440,13,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.


Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.
Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that the class characteristics of the two bullets were the same, but there was not sufficient agreement among the individual characteristics. My comparison was inconclusive.


Q: How did you arrive at that decision?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. When there is not strong agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as inconclusive. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.34.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is not sufficient agreement between the two bullets, which suggests that the results are inconclusive. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.
Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that when one firearm fires two bullets, the individual markings are so similar that you can say that they were fired from a single gun?
A: Yes, when there is significant similarity, the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: So that is not what you observed in this case?
A: In this case, while the class markings were consistent, there was not significant similarity among the individual characteristics - leading to an inconclusive determination.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?

A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that there is not enough identifying information to make a different conclusion. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

440,14,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.


Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.
Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that the class characteristics of the two bullets were the same, but there was not sufficient agreement among the individual characteristics. My comparison was inconclusive.


Q: How did you arrive at that decision?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. When there is not strong agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as inconclusive. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.34.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is not sufficient agreement between the two bullets, which suggests that the results are inconclusive. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.
Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

---Cross Examination---

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that when one firearm fires two bullets, the individual markings are so similar that you can say that they were fired from a single gun?
A: Yes, when there is significant similarity, the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: So that is not what you observed in this case?
A: In this case, while the class markings were consistent, there was not significant similarity among the individual characteristics - leading to an inconclusive determination.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, there is not a firm conclusion associated with values between 0.3 and 0.8.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.
Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that the class characteristics of the two bullets were the same, but there was not sufficient agreement among the individual characteristics. My comparison was inconclusive.


Q: How did you arrive at that decision?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. When there is not strong agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as inconclusive. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.34.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is not sufficient agreement between the two bullets, which suggests that the results are inconclusive. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.
Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

---Cross Examination---

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that when one firearm fires two bullets, the individual markings are so similar that you can say that they were fired from a single gun?
A: Yes, when there is significant similarity, the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: So that is not what you observed in this case?
A: In this case, while the class markings were consistent, there was not significant similarity among the individual characteristics - leading to an inconclusive determination.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, there is not a firm conclusion associated with values between 0.3 and 0.8.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were inconclusive, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that there is not enough identifying information to make a different conclusion. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.Q: Please state your name.

",1658425010,11,Inconclusive,Yes,Yes,1658425655,13693,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.


Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right.

This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.
Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.
Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.
Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that the class characteristics of the two bullets were the same, but there was not sufficient agreement among the individual characteristics. My comparison was inconclusive.


Q: How did you arrive at that decision?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. When there is not strong agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as inconclusive. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.34.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is not sufficient agreement between the two bullets, which suggests that the results are inconclusive. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.
Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

---Cross Examination---

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that when one firearm fires two bullets, the individual markings are so similar that you can say that they were fired from a single gun?
A: Yes, when there is significant similarity, the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: So that is not what you observed in this case?
A: In this case, while the class markings were consistent, there was not significant similarity among the individual characteristics - leading to an inconclusive determination.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, there is not a firm conclusion associated with values between 0.3 and 0.8.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were inconclusive, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that there is not enough identifying information to make a different conclusion. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.

440,18,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.


Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

A: The match score was 0.34.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is not sufficient agreement between the two bullets, which suggests that the results are inconclusive. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.
Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

---Cross Examination---

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that when one firearm fires two bullets, the individual markings are so similar that you can say that they were fired from a single gun?
A: Yes, when there is significant similarity, the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: So that is not what you observed in this case?
A: In this case, while the class markings were consistent, there was not significant similarity among the individual characteristics - leading to an inconclusive determination.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, there is not a firm conclusion associated with values between 0.3 and 0.8.
Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were inconclusive, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that there is not enough identifying information to make a different conclusion. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.

497,6,"Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.","Testimony

497,8,"Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

497,10,"Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Testimony

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Testimony

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

microscope
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

test_fire
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.

Testimony

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.

497,13,"Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Testimony

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

microscope
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

test_fire
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.
---Exhibit E---

Testimony

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.

Testimony

Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Testimony

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

microscope
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

test_fire
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.
---Exhibit E---

tree_grid

Testimony

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Testimony

---Cross Examination---

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.

Testimony

Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

497,15,"Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

497,16,"Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Testimony

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

microscope
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

test_fire
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.
---Exhibit E---

tree_grid

Testimony

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Testimony

---Cross Examination---

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.

Testimony

Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Testimony

Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.
---Exhibit F---

shoulder
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Testimony

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

microscope
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

test_fire
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.
---Exhibit E---

tree_grid

Testimony

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Testimony

---Cross Examination---

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.

Testimony

Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Testimony

Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.

Testimony

Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.
---Exhibit F---

shoulder
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Testimony

A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1. Exhibit G shows two matching signatures, while Exhibit H shows two non-matching signatures.

These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.

Q: Have you tested this algorithm?
A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners' visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

497,18,"Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Testimony

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement. Exhibit C shows an image of a comparison microscope, as well an an example of a matching bullet comparison.
---Exhibit C---

microscope
Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976. Exhibit D shows the comparison grid between the two test-fired bullets.
---Exhibit D---

test_fire
Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel. Exhibit E shows the comparison grid between the test-fired bullet and the fired evidence.
---Exhibit E---

Testimony

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

Testimony

---Cross Examination---

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.

Testimony

Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general number that's out there.

Testimony

Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.

Testimony

Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis. Exhibit F shows the identification of a land.
---Exhibit F---

shoulder
Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Testimony

A: The signature for the two bullets being compared are aligned such that the best fit between the two signatures is achieved. The striation marks between the two signatures are then compared by evaluating how many of the high points and low points correspond. The algorithm can calculate the number of consecutively matching striations (CMS), or consecutively matching high points and low points - these are features used directly by some examiners to characterize the strength of a match. It also calculates the cross correlation between the two signatures, which is a numerical measure of the similarity between the two lands ranging between -1 and 1. Exhibit G shows two matching signatures, while Exhibit H shows two non-matching signatures.
---Exhibit G---

---Exhibit H---

signature
These traits are combined using what is known as a random forest. Each forest is composed of decision trees, which use a subset of the observed values in order to make a decision about whether or not the bullets constitute a match. The other observations are held out in order to determine an error rate. When the random forest makes a prediction, each decision tree “ votes ” , producing a numerical value between 0 and 1 corresponding to the proportion of trees which evaluate the features as being sufficiently similar to have come from the same source.

Q: Have you tested this algorithm?
A: Yes. This algorithm was tested and validated on a number of different test sets of bullet scans. It was found that, as long as there are sufficient marks on the bullet, the algorithm could successfully distinguish between bullets fired by the same gun and those fired from different guns. Examiners' visual comparisons are also limited by the presence or absence of individualizing marks. Two test sets were using consecutively rifled barrels, which should be the most difficult to assess, and it was shown that the algorithm could distinguish between the bullets fired from two separate guns with complete accuracy.

497,19,"Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right. Exhibit A depicts a cross-section of a barrel, where rifling is clearly present. Exhibit B depicts an example of a fired bullet, with which includes lands and grooves.

Q: Can this algorithm be used on 9mm bullets fired from a Ruger LCP firearm, such as the firearm in question for this case?
A: Yes, this algorithm can be used on these types of bullets, given that this type of firearm marks well.

Q: Has this algorithm been published?
A: Yes. The algorithm and its process have been discussed in peer reviewed journals such as Law, Probability, and Risk , The Annals of Applied Statistics , and Forensic Science International . The algorithm is also open source, which means that the full source code, documentation, and numerical weights are available online for anyone to examine.

Q: How long has the bullet matching algorithm been used in court cases?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: This algorithm requires some decision making on the part of the operator, such as how much the signature is smoothed and what part of the bullets are inputted into the system, correct?
A: Yes, there are certain parameters which must be specified, but the system defaults are usually sufficient and have been validated with a number of different firearms and ammunition types. There are also operating protocols for determining which parts of the bullet are scanned, so while this process is manual, there are clear criteria and the associated variability from scanning is well understood, and published in Forensic Science International .

Q: Can this algorithm be applied to all bullets?
A: No, the algorithm only works on traditionally rifled bullets which are largely undamaged. The algorithm has not been validated to work on seriously damaged or fragmented bullets.","Testimony

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing.

Description

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.","Description

Testimony

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.","Testimony

Description

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Q: What work did you do on this case?

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.


---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.

547,10,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Description

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Testimony

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.


---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
Testimony

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?

547,11,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Description

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Testimony

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.


---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
Testimony

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.


---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
Testimony

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

547,13,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Description

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

547,14,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Description

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Testimony

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.


---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
Testimony

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

estimony

---Cross Examination---

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.

547,16,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Description

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Testimony

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.


---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
Testimony

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

estimony

---Cross Examination---

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Testimony

Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

Testimony

Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis.

Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

547,17,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Description

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Testimony

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.


---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
Testimony

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

estimony

---Cross Examination---

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Testimony

Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general

These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis.

Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

547,19,"In this case, the defendant - Richard Cole - has been charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business. This crime is a felony.

Mr. Cole has pleaded not guilty to the charge.

You will now hear a summary of the case. This summary was prepared by an objective court clerk. It describes all of the evidence that was presented at trial.

Description

Police received a 911 call from a convenience store clerk stating that a man had entered the store, pulled out a firearm, fired a shot into the ceiling, and then demanded money. The man ended up leaving the store without receiving any money and no one was hurt by the gunshot.

The store clerk took the stand and stated that she did not get a close enough look at the robber's face to make an identification, because the robber wore a ski mask.

As the cashier was pulling out the money to hand to him, she pressed a hidden button that activated an alarm and called the police. Startled by the alarm bells, the robber rushed out of the store.

Next, the detective testified that he arrived at the convenience store and interviewed the clerk. The detective recovered the 9mm bullet from the ceiling of the store, which was collected for forensic analysis.

Two days later, a police officer pulled over Richard Cole for speeding. During a search of the Defendant's vehicle, the detective located a 9mm handgun, which was legally licensed to the Defendant. Because this gun was the same caliber as the one used in the convenience store shooting, it was confiscated for testing. Richard Cole was subsequently arrested and charged with willfully discharging a firearm in a place of business.

Testimony

Q: Please state your name.
A: Terry Smith.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: The local police department.

Q: What do you do for the police department?
A: I am a firearms examiner.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 7 years.

Q: What is a firearms examiner?
A: A firearms examiner is someone who looks at cartridge cases and bullets to determine whether they were fired from a particular firearm.

Q: What training is required to become a firearms examiner with the local police department?
A: I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.

Testimony

Q: And during the course of your career, were you tested in proficiency to make sure you were still conducting appropriate examinations?
A: Yes. I have undergone annual proficiency examinations.

Q: Is the local police department lab accredited?
A: Yes, it is accredited by ASCLID/LAB.

Q: And in addition to what you just told us, do you have other qualifications?
A: Yes, I do.

Q: Can you tell us what those are?
A: Yes. I received training in the use of a bullet matching algorithm. This is an algorithm that evaluates the characteristics of two fired bullets, in order to produce a score for the similarity of the bullets, where more similar bullets are more likely to have been fired from the same gun. I attended a workshop on the algorithm on 1/11/2020, held by CSAFE - Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence. The training taught me to use the algorithm alongside my personal judgement. I found that my conclusion was reflected in the similarity score produced by the algorithm in all 21 cases.

Testimony

Q: Where does the bullet matching algorithm come from?
A: It was created by Dr. Adrian Jones.

Q: How long have the state police been using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: They have been using it since January of 2020.

Q: Have you testified in court previously using the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes, I have, approximately 10 times.

Q: As a firearms examiner, have you testified about your conclusions, given the results of your testing?
A: Yes, I have.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Terry Smith be qualified as an expert in the field of firearms identification subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of firearms identification. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts. Go ahead.

Testimony

Q: What work did you do on this case?
A: I was asked to compare a bullet from the crime scene to a test fire from the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: Did you examine how many lands and grooves the bullet had?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you explain for the jury what that means?
A: Yes. In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.

Testimony

Q: Now, for these bullets, you counted up the lands and grooves and determined the direction of the twist, correct?
A: Yes. This bullet had six lands. And the interior of the barrel, the barrel will either twist right or it will twist left. And in this particular case, the barrel twists right. And you can see that by looking at the bullet. If you look at the base of the bullet, either it goes to the left or goes to the right.


---Test-fired bullets admitted into evidence---


Q: Can you describe the process of obtaining these test-fired bullets?
A: The test-fired bullets came from a test fire of the gun recovered from the traffic stop.

Q: You mentioned test firings; can you explain what that means?
A: In test firing, first what I would do is make sure the firearm is safe to actually test fire. Then I would use lab ammunition and I would test fire it, meaning that I am creating a fired bullet. Typically you do two at a time. That way you have a fired bullet to compare to another fired bullet.

Q: Would you then have taken the test firings you created and did you compare those test firings to the fired evidence that you had also received?
A: Yes. First what I would do is compare my test shot to test shot. I am looking for a detailed microscopic pattern. Once I have done that then I would compare it to the fired evidence.

Q: And how about the number of lands and direction of twist for the test fires?
A: It also had six lands, and twisted to the right.

Q: Okay. Now, did you compare the test-fired bullets to the fired evidence under the comparison microscope?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: What is your conclusion?
A: I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel.

Q: How were you able to conclude that?
A: I place them under the comparison microscope, and I roll the bullet around until I can see the agreement in a particular area: unique surface contour that has sufficient agreement. At that point, when I've seen that, I start to rotate the bullets around and I look at all the different lands and grooves, impressions, for that unique detail. When I can see those, that agreement on multiple areas of the bullet, I identify the bullet as having sufficient agreement.
Testimony

Q: Did you use an algorithm to compare these bullets as well?
A: Yes, I used the algorithm to compare the two test fires to each other. I also used the algorithm to compare the better-marking test fire to the fired evidence that I received.

Q: Could you explain how this algorithm compares bullets?
A: The algorithm uses 3D measurements to make a comparison between the surface contours of each of the lands on each bullet. These comparisons result in a match score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a clear match, and 0 indicates that there is not a match. The bullet is aligned based on the maximum agreement between the lands, and the average match score for the lands is computed. This average score gives an overall match score for the entire bullet.

Q: What was the match score between the two test-fired bullets?
A: The match score was 0.976.

Q: What was the match score between the better-marked test fire bullet and the fired evidence?
A: The match score was 0.989.

Q: What does this match score indicate about the bullets?
A: The match score indicates that there is substantial similarity between the two bullets, which suggests that they were most likely fired from the same barrel.

Q: Now, how many times have you compared bullets to determine if they were fired from the same gun?
A: I'd say thousands.

Q: And do you ever see two bullets that have agreement in every single area of the bullet?
A: No. When firing a firearm there is a dynamic process because it is a contained explosion. When the firing pin hits the primer, which is basically the initiator, what gets it going, it will explode, burn the gun powder inside the casing, and the bullet will travel down the barrel, picking up the microscopic imperfections of the barrel, and the cartridge case will slam rearward against the support mechanism. During that dynamic process, each time it happens, a bullet will be marked slightly differently from one to the next.

Q: When you reached a conclusion, did you write up a report?
A: Yes, I did.

Q: Is it the local police department's protocol to have somebody else who's a firearms tool mark examiner in your lab review that report, review your work, and determine if it's correct?
A: Yes.

Q: That's what we call peer review?
A: Peer review, yes.

Q: Thank you, no further questions.

estimony

---Cross Examination---

Q: Now, are you telling the jury today that in your opinion there's only one gun in the entire world that could have produced the markings that you saw on these bullets?
A: I'm saying that the probability that the two markings were made by different sources is so small that it is negligible.

Q: Exclusive to any other gun?
A: I obviously haven't tested every other gun, but the probability is negligible.

Q: That's your opinion. And your opinion, by the way, is subjective, right? And it's based on your experience?
A: Based on my training and experience, yes.

Q: Is there something fixed about the amount of what has to be found to constitute sufficient agreement?
A: No, there is not a fixed amount or a numerical value for my visual comparison. For the algorithm, however, a score above 0.8 is a general indicator of sufficient agreement.
Testimony

Q: How long did you say you've been trained in the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: The software uses modeling; is that correct?
A: Yes, it does.

Q: You, personally, don't know the source code; is that correct?
A: That's correct.

Q: And, in fact, you, personally, would not be able to tell us the specific math that goes into this program; is that fair to say?
A: We did receive training on what the math is doing in general terms, but I am not a statistician, and would prefer to let them speak to that.

---Questions Submitted By the Jury---

The Court: Terry Smith, the jury has asked me to forward this question to you. Answer if you're able. To what percentage is the science accurate is the first question. And then I think the rest of that explanation of that question goes on to say, to determine that the bullets were fired from the same firearm, are you 100 percent sure?
A: My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners. The false positive identification rate is less than two percent. I believe it's about 1.5 to 1.9. That's just a general

Q: Please state your name.
A: Adrian Jones.

Q: Who do you work for?
A: CSAFE, the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence.

Q: What is your current occupation?
A: I am currently a Professor of Statistics.

Q: How long have you been doing that?
A: 30 years.

Q: What are your qualifications with regards to the bullet matching algorithm?
A: I have a Ph.D. in Statistics, and I have spent 7 years developing the bullet matching algorithm. I have spent 8 years collaborating with firearms examiners during the development and rollout of this algorithm.

Q: Are you familiar with the bullet matching algorithm?
A: Yes. I was involved in the development of the algorithm.

Prosecution: Your Honor, at this time I would ask that Adrian Jones be qualified as an expert in the bullet matching algorithm, subject to cross examination.
Court: Any cross on their credentials?
Defense: No, Your Honor.
Court: This witness is an expert in the area of the bullet matching algorithm. They can testify to their opinions as well as facts.

Testimony

Q: How many times have you testified regarding this bullet matching algorithm?
A: 17 times.

Q: Could you describe how this bullet matching algorithm compares bullets?
A: Yes. For certain types of guns, the barrel will have lands and grooves, known as rifling. This rifling spins the bullet in order to make its trajectory more stable. Due to the manufacturing process, this rifling can produce identifiable markings on the bullet, based on random differences between barrels. Because of these random imperfections, the striation marks left on bullets can be compared in order to determine if it is likely that they were fired from the same gun.

The first step is to determine where the lands on the bullet are located. These lands will be the sunken area that contains the striation marks between the smoother grooves. 3D scans are then taken for each land, and the “ shoulders ” , or area transitioning from the land to the grove, are excluded from the analysis.

Next, a stable area of the 3D scan containing the striations is selected, and a cross-section of this area is used to show the striations along with the topology of the region. A smoothing function is applied to remove some of the imaging noise from the 3D scan, leaving the striae intact. A second smooth is subtracted from the striations in order to remove the curvature of the region, leaving only the striae - this is what we call a signature.

Q: Can this algorithm be used on 9mm bullets fired from a Ruger LCP firearm, such as the firearm in question for this case?
A: Yes, this algorithm can be used on these types of bullets, given that this type of firearm marks well.

Q: Has this algorithm been published?
A: Yes. The algorithm and its process have been discussed in peer reviewed journals such as Law, Probability, and Risk , The Annals of Applied Statistics , and Forensic Science International . The algorithm is also open source, which means that the full source code, documentation, and numerical weights are available online for anyone to examine.
Q: How long has the bullet matching algorithm been used in court cases?
A: Since January of 2020.

Q: Okay. So that's fairly new, is that fair to say?
A: It is still fairly new, yes.

Q: This algorithm requires some decision making on the part of the operator, such as how much the signature is smoothed and what part of the bullets are inputted into the system, correct?
A: Yes, there are certain parameters which must be specified, but the system defaults are usually sufficient and have been validated with a number of different firearms and ammunition types. There are also operating protocols for determining which parts of the bullet are scanned, so while this process is manual, there are clear criteria and the associated variability from scanning is well understood, and published in Forensic Science International .

Q: Can this algorithm be applied to all bullets?
A: No, the algorithm only works on traditionally rifled bullets which are largely undamaged. The algorithm has not been validated to work on seriously damaged or fragmented bullets.

In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel.

Terry Smith. Firearms examiner I received my bachelor's degree in forensic science and in 2015 I transferred to the crime lab from the crime scene unit. I underwent a two-year training program, which was supervised by experienced firearms examiners; I've toured manufacturing facilities and saw how firearms and ammunition were produced; and I've attended several national and regional meetings of firearms examiners.
In the interior of a barrel there are raised portions called lands and depressed areas called grooves. When a bullet passes down the barrel, a bullet will spin and that gives it stability and accuracy over a distance. Those raised areas are designed by the manufacturer. They're cut into the barrel. And each particular file has a different combination of lands and grooves. But essentially what those lands do is grip a bullet and spin it, and as that bullet passes down the barrel, it scratches the random imperfections of that barrel into the bullet.   I found that there were sufficient individualizing characteristics to make an identification, that is that the two bullets were fired from the same barrel. My opinion, I am 100 percent sure that these bullets were fired from this firearm. There is a published error rate for firearms examiners.
